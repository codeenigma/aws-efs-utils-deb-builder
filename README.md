# AWS EFS deb builder
This is simply a wrapper repo, that does nothing but pre-build .deb packages for https://github.com/aws/efs-utils and make them available as releases at https://github.com/codeenigma/aws-efs-utils-deb-builder/releases.

This is used by [`ce-provision`](https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision) in the [`aws_efs_client` role](https://github.com/codeenigma/ce-provision/tree/1.x/roles/aws/aws_efs_client).
